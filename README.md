# PK_Simulation
This repository contains several Jupyter Notebooks that can do the PKPD simulation, with different scenarios:
1) PK_variability_simulation.ipynb: Simulate PK and PD profiles considering the unexplained interindividual variability
2) Combine_Dosing_Regimen.ipynb: Simulate PK profiles of combined two dosing regimens
